            </h2>
            <p>Before I wrote a single line of code, I went back to the source. A game I played as a kid in South
                Africa. The rules were simple: a piece of paper, a pen, and a group of friends in the same room. The
                goal? To build a sentence together, one hidden word at a time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>The Method: The ClayByte's Way</h3>
            <p>That game became the blueprint for the 'ClayByte's Method.' It's a deliberate process of turning
                real-world human interactions into meticulously crafted software. The game itself, <em>The Agame</em>,
                is the living proofâ€”a case study in building with purpose and precision.</p>
            <p>This is the engineering philosophy I live by, and it is the method I teach at the I.T. Dojo.</p>

            <h3>Our Mission: The Three Pillars</h3>
            <p>ClayByte's stands on three pillars to create a self-sustaining ecosystem for talent and innovation:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Academy (YouTube & Discord):</strong> Our open lecture hall and workshop, where we train
                    the next generation of engineers.</li>
                <li><strong>The Lab (Real-World Projects):</strong> Our students build a portfolio by contributing to
                    real, shipped products like <em>The Agame</em>.</li>
                <li><strong>The Pipeline (Strategic Talent Placement):</strong> We deliver a pipeline of elite,
                    AI-augmented engineers directly into the tech industry.</li>
            </ul>
