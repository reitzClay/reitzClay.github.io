    <h2>"I grew up in the 90's and spent my childhood in the Koue-bokkeveld and Warme-bokkeveld, South-Africa. 
        I grew up playing outside with bricks and sticks, the bricks was my cars and busses, the sticks was my horsies and this was all imagination play. 
        <br><br>Computers was the new thing on the block, it was so new that only a few had access to computers and internet dail-up connections. 
        I believe that persons who grew up with imaginative play leaves a lot of room for a whole load of innovation and imagination. 
        <br><br>Because of this reason, I believe that people who grew up like this have an innate ability to use their imagination for all sorts of things.
        <br><br>Imagination is all you need to be a software engineer, dedication of course along with discipline and a will to learn and sheer resilience.<br>
        <br>But why would you want to listen to me ? <br>I have been a software engineer for over a decade, but that is not the ability I have to make you soak up code like a sponge. 
        <br>The ability I have is to take concepts and break them down and explain it so that it is easy to understand."

          That is a correct observation, this is the training ground for those who want to start with software programming, and become tech savvy. 
          This is very simplistic website consisting of Html, Css and a little bit of JavaScript. and it is hosted for free on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github pages</a>
          Now is the perfect time to start programming "</h3>
