            I grew up in the Koue and warme bokkeveld, that is literally Karoo area, I was born in 1988, I grew up in the 90's, that meant no internet or any luxuries. I grew up playing with bricks and sticks, the bricks was my cars and busses and the sticks was my horsies and computers was the new thing on the block, it was so new that only the wealthy had access to computers and internet Modem dial up connections. 

I believe that as a person who grew up in these circumstances with few toys and a whole lot of imagination leaves a lot of room for a whole load of innovation. Growing up in South-Africa, there are loads of people that grew up similarly to the way I did, using our imaginations for play time. Because of this specific reason, I believe that people who grew up like this have an innate affinity/ability to use their imagination.

Imagination is all you need to be a software engineer, and dedication of course along with discipline and a will to learn.

But why would you want to listen to me ? I have been a software engineer for over a decade, but that is not the ability I have to make you soak up code like a sponge. The ability I have is to take concepts and break them down and explain it so that it is easy to understand.
